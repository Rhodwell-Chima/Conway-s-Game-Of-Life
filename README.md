# Conway's Game Of Life

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python. The Game of Life is a cellular
automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells that can be either alive or dead,
and the state of each cell changes based on the states of its neighbors.
